<p>Teleportation Works is a mod that focuses on providing you, the weary traveler or hunter, with magical tools of teleportation. Craft <strong>Teleport Beacons</strong> and place them in your favorite locations in the world - in ANY dimension - so you or anyone else can teleport to them later using a <strong>Wand of Teleportation</strong>, another Teleport Beacon, or even the area effect <strong>Splash Potion of Teleportation</strong>. Throw one of these potions at an entity, or shoot them with a <strong>Tipped Arrow of Teleportation</strong> from any bow, and instantly teleport the target to your active teleport destination. Lay down a <strong>Teleport Rail</strong> and instantly teleport a minecart and its passenger to any other Teleport Rail. So many possible uses, and more to come!</p>
